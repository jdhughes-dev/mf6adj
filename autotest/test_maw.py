"""
Tests for the multi-aquifer well terms of the adjoint solution.

A multi-aquifer well head is a dependent variable, and MODFLOW 6 solves it with
the flow equations rather than outside them, so the well's own equation is
already a row of the matrix the adjoint is taken from. What the adjoint forms
is the right-hand side of that row: the derivative of a performance measure
with respect to the well head, and the storage the well carries from one time
step to the next.

The exchange between a well and a cell follows the head in the cell twice over,
through the head difference and through the saturated fraction of the screen
that sets the conductance. A measure of that exchange has to carry both or it
is wrong by the second, which is the larger error where the screen is only
partly saturated.

Cases:
  - test_flux_measure            : a measure of the exchange at one cell
                                   matches a finite-difference derivative, for
                                   a well whose head is solved and one whose
                                   head is held, over one time step and four.
  - test_conductance_derivative  : dropping the conductance derivative moves
                                   the answer, so the test above is testing it.
  - test_head_measure            : a head measure in a model with a well
                                   matches a finite-difference derivative.
  - test_inactive_well           : an inactive well exchanges nothing and
                                   leaves the sensitivities alone.
  - test_two_packages            : two well packages keep their own rows.
  - test_rate_sensitivity        : the sensitivity of the measure to the rate a
                                   well is given matches a finite-difference
                                   derivative.
  - test_head_sensitivity        : the same for the head a well is held at.
  - test_terms_match_the_status  : a well carries a sensitivity to the rate it
                                   is given or to the head it is held at, never
                                   to both, and an inactive well to neither.
  - test_conductance_sensitivity : the same for the conductance of each
                                   connection, including one whose screen is
                                   partly saturated and one whose well head is
                                   held.
  - test_measure_on_maw_accepted : a measure naming a maw6 package is accepted.
