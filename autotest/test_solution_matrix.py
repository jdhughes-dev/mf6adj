"""
Tests for the sparsity that locates the entries of the assembled matrix.

The adjoint is taken from the matrix MODFLOW assembled, so the row pointer and
column index that locate its entries have to be the solution's. They match the
groundwater flow grid's until a package adds its own equations, which puts a
column inside the row of every cell that package connects to.

Cases:
  - test_assembled_matrix_reproduces_equations : the assembled matrix and the
                                                 solution vector satisfy the
                                                 equations MODFLOW solved, with
                                                 and without a package that adds
                                                 equations.
  - test_grid_connectivity_misplaces_entries   : the grid connectivity does not
                                                 locate those entries once maw6
                                                 adds its own.
  - test_forward_file_carries_solution_ia_ja   : the forward solution file
                                                 carries the solution sparsity,
                                                 and it matches the grid's for a
                                                 model the adjoint supports.
  - test_extra_equations_are_refused           : a solution carrying equations
                                                 beyond the flow grid's is
                                                 refused rather than solved
                                                 short of equations.
  - test_missing_equations_are_refused         : a solution carrying fewer
                                                 equations than the flow grid
                                                 is refused as a sparsity that
                                                 does not belong to the grid.
  - test_mismatched_arrays_are_refused         : arrays that do not describe one
                                                 matrix are refused where the
                                                 matrix is assembled.
