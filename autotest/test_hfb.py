"""
Tests for the horizontal flow barrier terms of the adjoint solution.

A barrier adds no equations and exchanges no water. It changes the conductance
of the connections it sits on, and MODFLOW writes that changed conductance into
the array the flow equations are assembled from. A sensitivity to hydraulic
conductivity is the derivative of that conductance, so it has to carry the
barrier; formed without it, the sensitivity answers for a connection the model
does not have.

The barrier is given as a hydraulic characteristic. A positive one puts a
barrier of that conductance in series with the connection, which always lowers
it. A value of zero or less is read as a multiplier on the conductance instead,
which lowers it, raises it, or closes the connection entirely depending on the
magnitude. The two forms have different derivatives.

Cases:
  - test_horizontal_barrier   : the sensitivity to k11 at a cell beside a
                                horizontal barrier matches a finite-difference
                                derivative, and a cell with no barrier is
                                unaffected.
  - test_vertical_barrier     : the same for k33 across a barrier on a vertical
                                connection.
  - test_multiplier_form      : the same for a hydraulic characteristic given
                                as a multiplier, where it lowers the
                                conductance, raises it, and closes it.
  - test_factor_follows_the_form : a barrier in series always lowers the
                                conductance, and a multiplier does whatever it
                                says, including raising it.
  - test_hydchr_sensitivity   : the sensitivity to the hydraulic characteristic
                                a barrier is given matches a finite-difference
                                derivative, in series and as a multiplier, on a
                                horizontal and a vertical connection.
  - test_hydchr_not_reported_without_a_barrier : a model with no barrier
                                reports no barrier sensitivity.
  - test_barrier_matters      : dropping the barrier from the derivative moves
                                the answer, so the tests above are testing it.
  - test_no_barrier_unchanged : a model with no barrier writes no factor and
                                reports what it did before.
  - test_factor_is_one_away_from_a_barrier : the factor is one on every
                                connection a barrier does not sit on.
