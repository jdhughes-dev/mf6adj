"""Multi-aquifer well (MAW) coupling for the adjoint solution.

A multi-aquifer well head is a dependent variable, and MODFLOW solves it with
the flow equations rather than outside them, so the well's equation is already
one of the rows of the matrix the adjoint is taken from. Unlike a lake or a
reach, nothing here has to border the system or rebuild the well's equation.

What is left is the row each well occupies, the derivative of a performance
measure with respect to the well head, and the storage the well carries from
one time step to the next.
