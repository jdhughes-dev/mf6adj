"""Cross-section rating for a streamflow-routing reach.

A reach given more than one station-height point takes its discharge from the
conveyance of the wetted section rather than from a power of the depth, so the
5/3 rating of a rectangular reach does not hold. The section is a chain of
straight segments between the points, and MODFLOW 6 sums the conveyance of the
wetted part of each::

    K = sum_n a_n ** (5 / 3) * p_n ** (-2 / 3) / r_n
    qman = unitconv * K * sqrt(slope)

where a_n and p_n are the wetted area and wetted perimeter of segment n and
r_n is the reach roughness times the roughness fraction of the segment. Both
a_n and p_n follow the depth, and the derivative of the rating is taken from
them rather than from a perturbation of the discharge.

The wetted perimeter of the section also sets the streambed conductance, so
unlike a rectangular reach, whose conductance is its width at any depth, the
leakage of a reach with a cross section follows the depth through the
conductance as well as through the stage.
