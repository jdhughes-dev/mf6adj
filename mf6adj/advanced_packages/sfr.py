"""Streamflow routing (SFR) coupling for the adjoint solution.

A reach stage follows the flow through the reach, so it is a dependent variable
just as a lake stage is, and holding it fixed returns a partial derivative. The
adjoint system is bordered with one equation per reach, and those equations
carry the routing between reaches.

MODFLOW 6 sets a reach depth so that the Manning discharge equals the mean of
the flow entering and leaving the reach::

    qman(d) = (Q_in + Q_out) / 2,     Q_out = Q_in - leak

For a reach without a cross section the wetted perimeter is the reach width
with no depth dependence, so the discharge is a power of the depth::

    qman(d) = unitconv * width * d ** (5 / 3) * sqrt(slope) / roughness

and its derivative is that exponent times the discharge over the depth. A reach
with a cross section takes its discharge from the conveyance of the wetted
section instead, and that rating and its derivative are formed in
``sfr_cross_section``.
