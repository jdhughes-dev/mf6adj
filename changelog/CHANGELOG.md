## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- A model whose packages add their own equations to the MODFLOW 6 solution
  matrix is now rejected instead of returning corrupted sensitivities. The
  adjoint matrix is rebuilt from the groundwater-flow grid connectivity, which
  has no rows for those equations, so the coefficients were misaligned and the
  backward recursion diverged - on a 21-period model the sensitivities grew by
  about a factor of ten per period, reaching 1e18, with no indication that
  anything was wrong. `maw6` always adds equations, and an implicitly coupled
  lake (MODFLOW 6 6.8.0 and later) does too. `sfr6`, `lak6`, and `uzf6` are
  solved in the outer iteration, add nothing to the matrix, and are unaffected.

### Added

- `lak6` performance measures. A lake connection exposes the same nodelist,
  conductance, and flux terms as the other head-dependent boundaries, so a
  measure can now sum the exchange between a lake and the aquifer, and lake
  stage and conductance appear as parameters in the results.

### Fixed

- Boundary values are read from each package's own arrays rather than from
  `BOUND`. MODFLOW 6 leaves `BOUND` allocated but zeroed for these packages, so
  the stage and conductance sensitivities of `ghb6`, `riv6`, `drn6`, and `chd6`
  were reported as zero.
- A cell holding more than one boundary from the same package accumulates every
  boundary rather than keeping only the last one. A lake connected both
  vertically and horizontally to one cell, or two river reaches in one cell,
  previously contributed once.
- A flux performance-measure entry uses its weight. The forward value scales the
  package flux by the entry weight, but the adjoint right-hand side ignored it,
  so a weighted measure returned unscaled sensitivities.
- The direct term of a flux measure is applied only to the boundaries the
  measure names, and with that entry's weight. It was applied to every boundary
  of every head-dependent package as soon as a measure contained any flux entry,
  which biased the sensitivities to boundary parameters the measure never used.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-03

### Breaking changes

- `Mf6Adj.solve_adjoint()` and `PerfMeas.solve_adjoint()` no longer accept
  `skip_solve`. The flag applied to every performance measure form, but a
  transient `direct` or `residual` measure carries information backward from
  one time step to the next, so skipping a time step returned incorrect
  sensitivities with no indication that anything was wrong. Time steps with no
  entries are now skipped automatically, and only for the `instantaneous` form,
  where each time step is solved on its own and skipping is correct.
