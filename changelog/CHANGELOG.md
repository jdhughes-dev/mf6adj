## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- A model whose packages add their own equations to the MODFLOW 6 solution
  matrix is rejected instead of returning corrupted sensitivities. `maw6`
  always adds equations, and so does an implicitly coupled lake (MODFLOW 6
  6.8.0 and later); `sfr6`, `lak6`, and `uzf6` are solved in the outer
  iteration and are unaffected.

### Added

- `lak6` performance measures, so a measure can sum the exchange between a lake
  and the aquifer, with lake stage and conductance among the parameters.
- The lake water balance is solved with the flow equations, so a sensitivity to
  a lake with a free stage is a total derivative rather than one that holds the
  stage fixed. Outlets, stage-volume-area tables, rainfall, and evaporation are
  included, and a lake perched above the water table is coupled only through
  its stage, since the head beneath it no longer sets the leakage. Inflows routed to a lake by `mvr6`, and the stage dependence of a
  horizontal connection's conductance, are not, and are reported as warnings.

### Fixed

- Boundary values are read from each package's own arrays rather than from
  `BOUND`, which MODFLOW 6 leaves allocated but zeroed. The stage and
  conductance sensitivities of `ghb6`, `riv6`, `drn6`, and `chd6` were reported
  as zero.
- A cell holding more than one boundary from the same package accumulates all
  of them rather than keeping only the last.
- A flux performance measure uses its entry weight, and its direct term is
  applied only to the boundaries the measure names rather than to every
  head-dependent package.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-03

### Breaking changes

- `Mf6Adj.solve_adjoint()` and `PerfMeas.solve_adjoint()` no longer accept
  `skip_solve`. The flag applied to every performance measure form, but a
  transient `direct` or `residual` measure carries information backward from
  one time step to the next, so skipping a time step returned incorrect
  sensitivities with no indication that anything was wrong. Time steps with no
  entries are now skipped automatically, and only for the `instantaneous` form,
  where each time step is solved on its own and skipping is correct.
